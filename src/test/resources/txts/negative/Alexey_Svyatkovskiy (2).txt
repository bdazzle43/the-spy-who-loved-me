Experience
Research Assistant at Purdue University
June 2009 - Present (5 years 6 months)

Statistical data analysis, physics analysis, software engineering for the CMS experiment at the
CERN LHC.

• Analyze large amounts of complex data with Hadoop on a distributed system of computing
resources

- Developed pattern classification methods and software for signal extraction and background
suppression using decision trees and linear discriminant techniques

- Estimated backgrounds with semi-supervised data-driven techniques to reduce systematic error
- Developed unfolding method removing various detector effects to facilitate comparisons of data

and Monte Carlo simulations to the theoretical models
- Evaluated data properties using simultaneous fitting of multiple event classes

• Refined data mining workflow and software for data analysis utilizing multiple CPU cores taking
into account limited storage resources, and communication overhead between network nodes

- Optimized data structures and event size for large scale data analysis
• Develop and validate object-oriented software for reconstruction of complex particle collision
events from electronic signals from multi-particle detectors for use in physics analysis making use
of the Kalman filter algorithm
• Developed a pattern recognition algorithm to tag electromagnetic showers in CMS detector
chambers
• Participate in international team to develop software for validation and quality certification of
collected data utilizing C++, Python, and ROOT
• Communicate effectively with international groups within the collaboration

- Clearly and effectively present personal, team, and collaboration results for peer review in
weekly meetings, international conferences, collaboration meetings
• Develop communication with colleagues from various groups for prompt feedback

Visiting Physicist at CERN
May 2011 - July 2011 (3 months)

Data collection shifter responsible for running of multi-detector experiment. Performed real-time
monitoring of trigger system and data quality. Provided diagnostic and troubleshooting support for
possible problems related to trigger performance.



Visiting Physicist at Fermilab
January 2011 - February 2011 (2 months)

As a member of a small team, organized and facilitated analysis development workshop attended
by more than 40 international novices, peers, and executives. My responsibilities included:

• Developing and facilitating interactive tutorials involving scientific principles, practical applications
and programming
• Testing tutorial exercises

Teaching Assistant at Purdue University
August 2008 - May 2009 (10 months)

• Physics laboratory teaching assistant for a full-credit coarse on modern classical mechanics,
combining experimentation and modeling in VPython.
• Grader for full-credit undergraduate calculus course.
