1 person has recommended Linlin

"Linlin is a brilliant scientist with a natural talent and enthusiasm for research. This is evidenced by
the fact that even at a relatively early stage in her career she has already published at several high
class venues in Natural Language Processing and made a noticeable contribution to advancing
the state-of-the-art in her field. Linlin has a solid background in Computing and Mathematics and is
extremely dedicated, hard working and self-sufficient. Most of all she has a curious mind and really
wants to know why a given methods works and how it could be improved. She is eager to learn,
understands quickly and has excellent communication skills. It's been a pleasure to work with her
for four years!"

—Caroline  Sporleder,  advised Linlin at Universität des Saarlandes
