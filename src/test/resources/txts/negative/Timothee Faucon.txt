EXPERIENCE

Consultant April 2014
Timothée Faucon, inc. Montréal, QC

· Designed, implemented and optimized data management solutions in collaboration with an international multi-
disciplinary team.

Senior R&D Manager - Senior Researcher April 2008 - March 2014
Diagnos inc. – Company specialised in data analysis and processing Brossard, QC

· Led the development of a versatile in-house image processing library in order to make future release-ready de-
ployments 70% faster and more efficient thereby reducing development costs by about $500,000 per year.

· Managed highly skilled R&D team of PhD scientists and led the development of next generation of specialised
algorithms intended for screening of patients for ophthalmic or cardiac complications.

· Worked closely with executive management in the alignment to strategic business requirements, managing im-
pact of changes in those requirements as they arise.

· Engaged in sales and marketing processes as a technical expert to provide potential customers with accurate
information about products and to get relevant feedback to improve our products.

Innovation Manager and Research Engineer January 2007 - April 2008
ERM.S Group – Geo-statistics service provider in O&G industry Fontainebleau, France

· Designed and led the development as well as testing of new tools for geoscientists, such as more efficient data
filters, automatic geological structures detector and extractor, oil and gas reservoir’s volume estimation and also
nicer data views for results reports to customers.



· Managed relationship with partners and customers that helped guiding development and improving user expe-
rience of the product.

· Managed various R&D projects including notably the internally named GeodTect project which had a substantial
impact on the quality of proprietary geostatistical filterings by taking into account the dip of geological layers.

Ph.D. Student and Research Engineer November 2003 - January 2007
Mines ParisTech / ERM.S Group Fontainebleau, France

· Led the design, development, implementation, and integration of an innovative tool that reduced the processing
time of seismic data by 94% which increased internal efficiency, halved service costs and allowed the
company to attract and retain as customers large players in O&G industry. This work led to the publication of
a patent on Seismic Cube Segmentation (Patent No : WO2006FR0086520060418)

Intern - Engineer March 2003 - September 2003
CEA Cadarache, France

· Designed and developped algorithms for poly-chromaticity correction in high energy tomography studies with the
aim of enhancing resulting image quality to better identify objects in large and dense radioactive containers.

· Successful implementation of the poly-chromaticity correction algorithms led to their integration into a high
energy tomograph simulator used to provide a solution in safe radioactive wastes container caracterisation and
handling.
