EPITA: Ing√©nierie Informatique   Tampere University of Technology   Senior Software Engineer Criteo Within the scalability team, my first mission is to develop/maintain internal SDKs that run in a low-latency environment. Also, despite the fact that we had plenty of metrics to analyse latency problems, it occurred to me that we couldn't identify clearly which service or hardware was the cause of the problem. This is why we decided to integrate a distributed tracing system (http://zipkin.io). It is now up and running within the existing technical stack and with full horizontal scalability. Senior Software Engineer Murex Redesign from scratch of an old module written in C. Complete change of architecture from plain software to client/server architecture in Java. As the old module became unmaintainable we had, to ensure future maintainability and extensibility, to introduce great quality expectations (unit tests, integration tests, continuous refactoring, ...). I believe it was really successful because it lead to coaching new developments in Java in our team.
