Software Engineer Tapad Working on forecasting the result of advertising campaigns in real-time in a Big Data environment. Tapad is the leader in cross-device content delivery. Our groundbreaking, proprietary technology assimilates billions of data points to find the human relationship between smartphones, desktops, laptops, tablets, connected TVs and game consoles. The result: an unprecedented understanding of consumer behavior across related screens and the ability to reach the right people on the right device at the right time. With Tapad, publishers and advertisers can deepen consumer engagement with a more fluid experience while increasing campaign cost-effectiveness. Data Engineer Médiamétrie (Biggest French Audience Mesaurement Company) Exploring new ways of exploiting audience data in and Agile environment. Designing and testing new statistical models and computations with a primary focus on finding new growth drivers for the company. Creating innovative products that offer our clients better insights into their TV, internet or radio audience using latest available technologies such as Hadoop for BigData or NoSQL databases for efficient storages. Main projects include:  Led the development of the back-end and the service oriented architecture of a scalable web- based BI tool able to compute and visualize TV audiences in real time. Participated in the design of the computation engine. The entire application was set up on Amazon Web Services.  Led the development of a system that individualizes cable TV boxes in order to obtain global individual figures and determine who in a household is watching TV by using the unlabeled data owend by cable companies. Successfully implemented a statistical model based on hidden Markov chains paired with Hadoop MapReduce to handle multiple GBs of logs from the TV boxes. Apache Mahout and Apache Maths were the main libraries used to help solving the statistical problems. This project led to the creation of a new product for all TV cable companies to enable them to not only have TV boxes audience measurement but also individual audience measurement.  In a team with a statistician, extracted key figures from mobile and tablets usage data. Given the large quantity of data over time, scripts were written in Spark Scala and executed on AWS. Resulting aggregated data was then further handled in R. The goal was to identify patterns in order to later set up learning algorithms to extrapolate incomplete measured data. Software Engineer Mediametrie Improved the performance and the robustness of the production line. Enhanced interfaces between new and legacy systems. Developed a web interface to manage the services sold to Médiamétrie's clients. Software Engineer  Developed Java software on the Médiamétrie production line to improve the quality of the statistics of the French TV ratings. Set up the collected data among several thousands French households in order to generate specific figures about television audience. Designed efficient algorithms to meet the requirements. Freelance Software Engineer  Created highly efficient and easy to capture members contracts in Excel. Developed the whole contracts management software. Made Java tools to ensure direct debits from the bank and to generate specific financial statistics. Software Engineer - Internship RTE Created a Java tool to generate a C++ data model according to given XML-based specifications. The aim of the generated file was to be able to read and write large files describing the electric network state. Software Engineer - Intership INFOTEL Set up Web services to an existing Java digital archiving software. Developed Java and Visual Basic programs using this Web services to be provided as client samples.
