Internship in IS Architecture and Management OCTO Technology The goal of this internship was to produce a study on several Enterprise Architecture frameworks: IT referentials, architecture methodologies, technical debt, agility. The study was based on Zachman, TOGAF, Praxeme, FEA and DoDAF frameworks. Internship in Software Engineering (C#) SGCIB I was in charge of the development of a monitoring tool (functional and technical KPIs) for trading applications (derivaties). Through this internship I worked on the following technical subjects: - C#/WinForms on .NET 2.0, PerfMon, Reflection, .NET Remoting - As well as developing architecture skills: OO design patterns, multi-threading patterns, refactoring.
