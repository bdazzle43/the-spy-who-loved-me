EPITA   Software Engineer Criteo Work on the team that manage datas in criteo which includes both the user data and the data handle by our hadoop cluster. This leads me to work on some ways to handle a massive amount of data with the performance of the ingestion/analysis as the main problematic. For example: - Work on a framework that allow to retrieve realtime data from different types of data storage such as SQL sources, Memcache sources... - Improvement of Hadoop jobs and of the criteo's internal Framework for cascading. - Maintenance of a project whose role is to fetch datas from the hadoop cluster to the database that handle the user datas. - Work on several project owned by other teams to make some improvements and modifications - Experimental use of hadoop (Map-side join) - Start being a Scrum master for the team Last year student   Software Engineer Turn Working in the team that maintains the Data Management Platform for Turn.
