EPITECH - European Institute of Technology   Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1   Staff Software Engineer, R&D - SRE - Storage Criteo Doing (somewhat) distributed things with (a lot of) non-relational bytes. Senior Site Reliability Engineer Google Part of Storage-SRE, mainly focused on Bigtable. Making sure that Bigtable is available, scalable and efficient. My impact includes (but is not limited to): • Leading 5+ persons to add one more 9 to Bigtable's availability and divide the tail latency by 20. • Significant improvements to long-term Bigtable scalability. • Saving millions by improving human processes and software efficiency. • Storage consulting for teams such as Youtube or Google Analytics. • Incident response on critical services and post-incident follow ups to keep operational loads low. • Consulting within SRE and SWE teams at Google (Storage, Automation, Production) • Building tools for SRE teams in order to avoid work duplication. Linux kernel developer  Worked on X86 Platform drivers and embedded systems. Maintainer of: • Asus platform drivers: asus-laptop, eeepc-laptop, asus-wmi, eeepc-wmi • Samsung platform drivers: samsung-laptop Contributed to: • MTD subsystem (access to nand flash devices) and related (UBI, libblkid, mtd-utils, UBIFS) • Android-x86 port • rfkill R&D Engineer commonIT Work on the Virtual Browser client and server. Virtual Browser is a web browser that is not executed on the user's end-point device (PC, laptop, PDA, or other) but on a dedicated virtual server in the enterprise DMZ or hosted as a service “in the cloud”. Virtual Browser offers a previously unattainable level of security by centralizing and isolating browser instances on a dedicated server. * Port of the Virtual Browser agent on iPhone and Maemo (actually, aslo run on OSX/Linux/Windows thanks to Qt). * Easy-to-use Virtual Browser server clustering. * Authentication modules for Kerberos, Radius, PKI, Ldap * Kerberos and PKCS11 proxies (over the network) * Virtual Browser client and server (UI, network protocols, python, etc...) Contribution to Free Software such as: GlusterFS, NX, mozplugger. Managing commonIT Open Source website (http://floss.commonit.com and http://commonit.com/en/technology/open-source). Hacker on QEMU/KVM (Google Summer Of Code 2010) Google Added new encodings to the QEMU's built-in VNC server to reduce the bandwidth required by VNC. Added Tight, Tight PNG, ZRLE and ZYWRLE encodings. Also wrote an adaptive encoding algorithm to switch between lossless and lossy encodings when video streams are detected. Another side of the project was parallelize the vnc server in order to avoid blocking guest while using heavy encodings. Main Developer  Android port on Eeepc and other netbooks. Made a 2.6.32 based android kernel from the official 2.6.29 android kernel. Fixed some rfkill stuff (bluetooth and wlan switchs). Contributor  MTD is a generic Linux subsystem for memory devices, especially Flash devices. Fixed bugs and added features to MTD, UBI, UBIFS, libblkid and mtd-utils. Web Developer/System Administrator  Zordania is a browser based game in an Heroïc Fantasy world. The web site is build using PHP/MySQL and Apache, Maradns, Postfix, Courier .. Embedded software engineer ADENEO Designed a Nand Flash filesystem which is now available under the GPL (http://git.iksaif.net/?p=nandfs.git;a=summary) . Port to Linux. WinCE Nand Flash drivers.
